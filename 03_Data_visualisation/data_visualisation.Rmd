# Introduction

In this practical, we will learn how to visualise data after we have cleaned up our datasets using the `dplyr` verbs from the previous practical. `filter()`, `arrange()`, `mutate()`, `select()`, `summarise()`. For the visualisations, we will be using a package that implements the grammar of graphics: `ggplot2`. 

Don't forget to open the project file `03_Data_visualisation.Rproj` and to create your `.Rmd` or `.R` file to work in.

```{r load_packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ISLR)
library(tidyverse)
```

An excellent reference manual for `ggplot` can be found on the tidyverse website: [https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/)

# What is `ggplot`

Plots can be made in `R` without the use of `ggplot` using `plot()`, `hist()` or `barplot()` and related functions. Here is an example of each on the `Hitters` dataset from `ISLR`:

```{r baseplots}
# Get an idea of what the Hitters dataset looks like
head(Hitters)

# histogram of the distribution of salary
hist(Hitters$Salary, xlab = "Salary in thousands of dollars")

# barplot of how many members in each league
barplot(table(Hitters$League))


# number of career home runs vs 1986 home runs
plot(x = Hitters$Hits, y = Hitters$HmRun, 
     xlab = "Hits", ylab = "Home runs")
```

These plots are informative and useful for visually inspecting the dataset, and they each have a specific syntax associated with them. `ggplot` has a more unified approach to plotting, where you build up a plot layer by layer using the `+` operator:

```{r ggplot1}
homeruns_plot <- 
  ggplot(Hitters, aes(x = Hits, y = HmRun)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Hits", y = "Home runs")

homeruns_plot
```

As introduced in the lectures, a `ggplot` object is built up in different layers:

1. input the dataset to a `ggplot()` function call
2. construct aesthetic mappings
3. add (geometric) components to your plot that use these mappings
4. add labels, themes, visuals.


Because of this layered syntax, it is then easy to add elements like these fancy density lines, a title, and a different theme:

```{r ggplot2}
homeruns_plot + 
  geom_density_2d() +
  labs(title = "Cool density and scatter plot of baseball data") +
  theme_minimal()
```

In conclusion, `ggplot` objects are easy to manipulate and they force a principled approach to data visualisation. In this practical, we will learn how to construct them.

---

__Name the aesthetics, geoms, scales, and facets of the above visualisation. Also name any statistical transformations or special coordinate systems.__

---

```{r question}
# Aesthetics: 
#   number of hits mapped to x-position
#   number of home runs mapped to y-position
# Geoms: points and contour lines
# Scales:
#   x-axis: continuous
#   y-axis: continuous
# Facets: None
# Statistical transformations: None
# Special coordinate system: None (just cartesian)
```


# Aesthetics and data preparation

The first step in constructing a `ggplot` is the preparation of your data and the mapping of variables to aesthetics. In the `homeruns_plot`, we used an existing data frame, the `Hitters` dataset. 

The data frame needs to have proper column names and the types of the variables in the data frame need to be correctly specified. Numbers should be `numerics`, categories should be `factors`, and names or identifiers should be `character` variables. `ggplot()` _always_ expects a data frame, which may feel awfully strict, but it allows for excellent flexibility in the remaining plotting steps.

---

__Run the code below to generate data. There will be three data vectors in your environment. Put them in a data frame for entering it in a `ggplot()` call using either the `data.frame()` or the `tibble()` function. Give informative names and make sure the types are correct (use the `as.<type>()` functions). Name the result `gg_students`__

---

```{r datavecs}
student_grade  <- rnorm(32, 7)
student_number <- round(runif(32) * 2e6 + 5e6)
programme      <- sample(c("Science", "Social Science"), 32, replace = TRUE)
```

```{r prepare}
gg_students <- tibble(
  number = as.character(student_number), # an identifier
  grade  = student_grade,                # already the correct type.
  prog   = as.factor(programme)          # categories should be factors.
)

head(gg_students)

# note that if you use data.frame(), you need to set the argument 
# stringsAsFactors to FALSE to get student number to be a character.
# tibble() does this by default.
```


Mapping aesthetics is usually done in the main `ggplot()` call. Aesthetic mappings are the second argument to the function, after the data frame. 

---

__Replicate the first `homeruns_plot`, but map the `Hits` to the y-axis and the `HmRun` to the x-axis instead.__

---


```{r hmrn2}
ggplot(Hitters, aes(x = HmRun, y = Hits)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Hits", y = "Home runs")
```

---

__Recreate the same plot once more, but now also map the variable `League` to the `colour` aesthetic and the variable `Salary` to the `size` aesthetic__

---

```{r hmrn3}
ggplot(Hitters, aes(x = HmRun, y = Hits, colour = League, size = Salary)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Hits", y = "Home runs")
```

Examples of aesthetics are:

- x
- y
- alpha (transparency)
- colour
- fill
- group
- shape
- size
- stroke


# Geoms

Up until now we have used two geoms: contour lines and points. The geoms in `ggplot2` are added via the `geom_<geomtype>()` functions. Each geom has a required aesthetic mapping to work. For example, `geom_point()` needs at least and x and y position mapping, as you can read [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html#aesthetics).

---

__Look at the many different geoms on the [reference website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-layer-geoms).__

---

There are two types of geoms: 

- geoms which perform a transformation of the data beforehand, such as `geom_density_2d()` which calculates contour lines from x and y positions.
- geoms which do not transform data beforehand, but use the aesthetic mapping directly, such as `geom_point()`.


# 
One of the most useful geoms is `geom_boxplot()`.

---

__Create a boxplot of student grades per programme in the `gg_students` dataset you made earlier: map the programme variable to the x position and the grade to the y position. For extra visual aid, you can additionally map the programme variable to the fill aesthetic__

---

```{r boxplot}
gg_students %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = prog, y = grade, fill = prog)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

__Does the `geom_boxplot()` transform the
