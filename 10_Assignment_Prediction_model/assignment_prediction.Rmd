Pass / Fail assignment

### Find a dataset and create and assess a prediction model. 
You can use data from anywhere. For example, you may use [Google dataset search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch), [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), a dataset from an `R` package, or something you collected yourself.

### Requirements
- explain the dataset in 1 or 2 paragraphs
- use `tidyverse`
- clean, legible `R` code (preferably following something close to the google style guide)
- explain which method you use (regression/classification and what exactly)
- assess your predictions 
- interpret the parameters of your method, if applicable
- make conclusions about your predictions
- use plots where useful (they are almost always useful)

### Format: stand-alone RStudio project folder
- Should have these components:
  - the dataset (csv, xlsx, sav, dat, json, or any other common format)
  - one .Rmd notebook file
  - a compiled .pdf or .html
