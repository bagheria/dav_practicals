Here is an example file you can write.

First, load the packages:

```{r load_packages}
library(ISLR)
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
```

1. Objects and classes

```{r objects}
object_1 <- 1:5
object_2 <- 1L:5L
object_3 <- "-123.456"
object_4 <- as.numeric(object_2)
object_5 <- letters[object_1]
object_6 <- as.factor(rep(object_5, 2))
object_7 <- c(1, 2, 3, "4", "5", "6")
```

```{r classes}
class(object_1)
# Here is a comment about the class of object_1
```

2. etcetera...
